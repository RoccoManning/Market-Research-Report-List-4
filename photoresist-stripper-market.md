<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Stripper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Type Photoresist Stripper</li><li>Negative Type Photoresist Stripper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive type photoresist stripper is a chemical solution used to remove positive photoresist materials from substrates after photolithography processes. It dissolves the photoresist layer exposed to UV light, leaving the unexposed areas intact. Negative type photoresist stripper, on the other hand, is used to remove negative photoresist materials, where the exposed areas become hardened and the unexposed areas are removed with the stripper. Both types of photoresist strippers are essential in the semiconductor and electronics industries for manufacturing processes.</p></p>
