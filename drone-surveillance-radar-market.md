<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drone Surveillance Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PSR(Primary Surveillance Radar)</li><li>SSR(Secondary Surveillance Radar)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Drone Surveillance Radar market consists of two main types - Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). PSR uses radio waves to detect and track drones by measuring the time it takes for the signals to bounce back, providing basic information like position and altitude. On the other hand, SSR supplements PSR by exchanging data with transponders on drones, providing additional details like identification and flight information. Both PSR and SSR play crucial roles in enhancing drone surveillance capabilities.</p></p>
