<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endoscopy CO2 Insufflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Smoke Aspirator</li><li>Without Smoke Aspirator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endoscopy CO2 Insufflator market can be categorized into two types - with Smoke Aspirator and without Smoke Aspirator. With Smoke Aspirator insufflators are equipped with a smoke evacuation system to remove smoke generated during surgical procedures, providing a clearer visualization for the surgeons. On the other hand, without Smoke Aspirator insufflators do not have this feature, which may result in reduced visibility due to the accumulation of smoke. Both types serve the purpose of insufflating carbon dioxide during endoscopic procedures but differ in the additional smoke evacuation functionality.</p></p>
