<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillator Electrodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implanted Defibrillator Electrodes</li><li>External Defibrillator Electrodes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Defibrillator electrodes are used in both implanted defibrillator systems and external defibrillators. Implanted defibrillator electrodes are designed to deliver electrical shocks directly to the heart through leads placed inside the body. External defibrillator electrodes are attached to the patient's chest to deliver shocks from outside the body. Both types of electrodes play a crucial role in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias by delivering controlled electrical impulses to restore normal heart rhythm.</p></p>
