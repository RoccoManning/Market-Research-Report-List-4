<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ball Screw Support Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Row</li><li>Double Row</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ball screw support bearings are classified into two main types: single row and double row. Single row ball screw support bearings consist of a single row of balls running in a raceway and are designed for applications with lower axial loads. On the other hand, double row ball screw support bearings have two rows of balls running in two parallel raceways, offering higher load capacity and increased rigidity for demanding applications. Both types play a crucial role in supporting the smooth and precise movement of ball screws in various industrial machinery.</p></p>
