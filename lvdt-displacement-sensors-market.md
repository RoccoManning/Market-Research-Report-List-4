<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LVDT Displacement Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact</li><li>Non-Contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LVDT Displacement Sensors are used in contact and non-contact applications. Contact sensors come in physical contact with the object being measured, providing accurate and precise readings. They are commonly used in industrial environments where the object can be easily accessed. On the other hand, non-contact sensors do not make physical contact with the object, making them suitable for delicate or hard-to-reach surfaces. These sensors use technologies like ultrasonic waves or lasers to measure displacement without affecting the object being measured.</p></p>
