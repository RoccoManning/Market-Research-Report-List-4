<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microwave Infrared Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microwave infrared detectors are commonly classified into two types: active and passive. Active detectors emit and receive signals to detect motion, making them more effective in larger areas. On the other hand, passive detectors only receive signals and cannot emit them, making them suitable for smaller areas or where energy conservation is a priority. Both types play a vital role in security systems, with active detectors offering greater accuracy and passive detectors requiring less power consumption.</p></p>
