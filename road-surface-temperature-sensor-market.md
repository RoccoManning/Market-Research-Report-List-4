<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Road Surface Temperature Sensors can be categorized into two types: active and passive. Active sensors generate their own signal or energy to measure the temperature of the road surface, providing real-time data. Passive sensors, on the other hand, rely on external energy sources to measure the temperature. Active sensors are preferred for their accuracy and ability to provide continuous monitoring, while passive sensors are often used in applications where cost or power consumption is a concern. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring road safety and maintenance.</p></p>
